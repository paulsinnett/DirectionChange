# Direction change

A small project to demonstrate a method for pursuing a target 2D space. (It should also work in 3D.)

Move with WASD or arrow keys, or a connected game pad. The sphere should follow by accelerating in the direction of the target. You can modify the maximum acceleration and maximum speed.

The target leaves a green trail and the pursuing object leaves a red trail, so you can see the effect of changing the maximum speed and acceleration.
